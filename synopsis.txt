PROBLEM STATEMENT
In today’s competitive job market, students and fresh graduates struggle to find internships and
entry-level jobs that truly match their skills and career aspirations. While numerous platforms
provide job listings, they are often cluttered with irrelevant content, self-promotional posts, and
networking noise, making it difficult to access genuine opportunities and expert guidance.
Many students remain unaware of the specific skills, resume optimizations, and industry
expectations that could set them apart. Traditional career counseling is often costly, generic, or
inaccessible, leaving them without personalized feedback or direct access to hiring professionals.
There is a pressing need for a focused, mentorship-driven platform that connects students
directly with HR professionals and technical experts from top companies. By offering
AI-powered resume analysis, career coaching, expert consultations, and direct access to curated
job listings, this system cuts through the clutter and streamlines the job search process,
significantly improving students’ chances of securing meaningful internships and jobs.
